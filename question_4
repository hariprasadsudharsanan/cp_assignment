In this program the rand() function is using twice and two numbers are generated.Then using"dicei=1+rand()%6".here one value is generated
and it is similarly for the "dice2" .Switch statement we can found sum 
of dice1 and dice 2 values are passed.
In the switch statement if the value of sum is 11 then the game satus will be won.
If the sum is 12 then the game satus will be also won. If no case is executed default case will executed. Her the game satus will be continue and my point will be sum.

From this the whole loop start to execute
If continue=gamesatus. In here the two loops are generated using rand()function 
will mentioned in the beginning and it will be stored in the dice 1 and dice 2. After sum of dice1 and dice2 will be calculated. 
Then the sum and mypoint will be compared
with If statement then If the condition is true
then the game satus will be won inside the else another if statement will check whether the sum is 7 ,If it true the game satus will be lost. And it will change the value of game satus .
Here the condition inside the loop is false 
and the condition will not run again.
If(sum==mypoint) is not true then the loop will running until the condition satisfied .

Then there another If statement 
If(won=gamesatus) if this statement is true the player will win else the loose.
